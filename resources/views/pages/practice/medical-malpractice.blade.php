                    You trusted a doctor. A hospital. A surgeon. And something went wrong that should not have gone wrong. Now you are dealing with consequences that will follow you for years, maybe forever.

                    Medical malpractice cases are among the hardest personal injury claims to win in New York. They require medical experts, meticulous records review, and an attorney who will not back down when a hospital’s legal team shows up swinging. We do not back down.

                <h2 class="heading-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">What Is Medical Malpractice in New York?</h2>
                <p style="color: var(--color-text-muted); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    A bad medical outcome is not automatically malpractice. But when a doctor, surgeon, hospital, or healthcare provider fails to meet the accepted standard of care and that failure causes you serious harm, that is malpractice. And it is something we fight hard.
                </p>
                <p style="color: var(--color-text-muted); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    Medical malpractice occurs when a healthcare provider deviates from the standard of care that a reasonably competent provider would follow in the same situation. The bad result alone is not enough. You have to prove the provider did something wrong, or failed to do something they should have done, and that failure directly caused your injury.
                </p>
                <div style="padding: 1.25rem; background: var(--color-bg-alt); border-left: 4px solid var(--color-accent); border-radius: var(--radius-md);">
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: var(--color-text); font-weight: 500;">
                        Proving that connection requires expert testimony. It requires someone in the same medical field to review the records and say, on the record, that the standard of care was breached. We build every case with licensed medical experts from the start. We review every record. We find where the standard of care broke down and who is responsible for it. Then we fight for everything you are owed.

                        New York has no statutory cap on medical malpractice damages. That means there is no artificial ceiling on what you can recover.

                        Economic damages cover medical bills, lost income, and future care costs. Non-economic damages cover pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and emotional harm. We pursue every category and fight for the full number.

                <p style="color: var(--color-text-muted); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    Surgery carries risk and every patient accepts that before going in. What no patient agrees to is a surgeon operating on the wrong site, or leaving an instrument inside the body, or causing nerve damage through careless technique.
                </p>
                <p style="color: var(--color-text-muted); line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
                    Those outcomes have a name and it is failure. The surgeon, the hospital, and the anesthesiologist can all bear liability depending on what happened and who controlled it. We investigate every layer and pursue every source of compensation available to you.

                    Some of the most devastating malpractice cases never involve a scalpel. A doctor who misreads imaging and sends a stroke patient home has caused harm just as real as any surgical mistake.
                </p>
                <p style="color: var(--color-text-muted); line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
                    A physician who dismisses chest pain without proper testing, and that patient suffers a heart attack hours later, has failed that person at the moment they needed care most. When a diagnostic failure causes a condition to worsen in ways that proper treatment would have prevented, we build the case that connects that failure to the full consequences and fight for everything those consequences are worth.

                <p style="color: var(--color-text-muted); font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
                    Birth injuries are among the highest-value medical malpractice cases in New York because the damages can span an entire lifetime. When oxygen is cut off during delivery and a child develops cerebral palsy, or forceps are applied incorrectly and cause permanent nerve damage, the consequences follow that child into every school year, every medical appointment, every part of a life that was supposed to begin without that weight. When a delivery room mistake costs a child a normal life, the hospital and the delivering physician must answer for it fully. We fight for the child and the family carrying that future alongside them.
                </p>

                <p style="color: var(--color-text-muted); font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
                    Emergency rooms run at a brutal pace and nobody expects them to be perfect. What patients do have a right to expect is that the physician treating them will run the appropriate tests, read the results correctly, and make decisions based on what the evidence actually shows. When a doctor sends someone home without imaging that would have caught a stroke, or discharges a patient who needed to be admitted, the speed of the environment does not excuse what happened. Emergency room malpractice causes permanent disability and death in New York City hospitals every year. We hold ER physicians and the hospitals employing them accountable when their failures cause serious harm.

                <p style="color: var(--color-text-muted); font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
                    Doctors practice inside systems that hospitals design, staff, and control. When those systems run chronically short on staff, skip proper supervision, or allow sanitary protocols to slip until a patient develops a post-surgical infection, the harm that results is institutional. It did not come from one person having a bad day. It came from decisions made at the organizational level that put patients at risk. When a hospital’s own failures contributed to your injury, the institution is liable alongside whoever was directly involved in your care. We pursue every responsible party.

                        New York enacted Lavern’s Law in 2018 specifically for patients whose cancer was missed or misdiagnosed. Before this law, the 2.5-year filing deadline started on the date of the negligent act, which often expired before the patient even knew something had gone wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: #cbd5e1; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">
                        The law changed that clock. For failure-to-diagnose cancer cases, the deadline now starts when the patient discovers the error or reasonably should have discovered it. If you were told your results were clear and later found out they were not, the rules governing your deadline are different from the standard ones.

                    New York’s statute of limitations for medical malpractice is <strong>2 years and 6 months</strong> from the date of the alleged malpractice, not the standard 3 years that applies to other personal injury claims.

                    <p>Two years and six months from the date of the malpractice in most cases. Public hospital cases require a Notice of Claim within 90 days. Cancer misdiagnosis cases follow different rules under Lavern’s Law. Call us immediately and do not assume you know which deadline applies.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes. New York requires a Certificate of Merit filed with every medical malpractice complaint. We retain the expert, review the records, and build that foundation before we file anything.</p>

                    <p>Known risks are not automatically malpractice. But if the risk materialized because of negligence, that is a different matter. We investigate what happened and whether the standard of care was followed. The doctor’s explanation is the beginning of the inquiry, not the end.</p>
